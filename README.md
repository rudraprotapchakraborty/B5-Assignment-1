### 1. **Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript**

In TypeScript, both **interfaces** and **types** are used to define the shape of data structures, but they come with different features and use cases. Here’s a deeper dive into their differences:

#### Key Differences:

* **Declaration Merging**:

  * **Interfaces** support **declaration merging**, meaning that you can declare the same interface multiple times, and TypeScript will automatically merge them together. This feature is especially useful when you want to extend or modify an interface in different parts of your code or libraries.
  * **Types**, on the other hand, do not support declaration merging. If you try to declare the same type more than once, TypeScript will throw an error. This means that types are fixed once they’re declared.

* **Extending**:

  * **Interfaces** use the `extends` keyword to inherit properties from other interfaces or classes. This makes interfaces ideal for defining clear, object-oriented structures and allows you to build upon existing interfaces without modifying the original.
  * **Types** use the `&` (intersection) operator to combine multiple types into a single type. This allows for more flexible and complex combinations of types, including merging object types, union types, and more.

* **Versatility**:

  * **Types** are more flexible because they can represent a variety of data structures. Besides defining objects, they can define primitive types (like `string` or `number`), tuples, unions, intersections, function signatures, and more. This makes types more suitable for scenarios that require advanced type combinations and complex relationships.
  * **Interfaces** are best suited for defining **object shapes** or class contracts, and they are more structured. Interfaces don’t have the same versatility as types when dealing with complex type combinations or non-object structures.

#### When to Use:

* Use **interfaces** when you want to define structured, object-oriented patterns or when you need to extend and merge definitions.
* Use **types** when you need more flexibility, such as when dealing with unions, intersections, or non-object data structures like primitives or tuples.

#### Summary:

* **Interfaces**: Best suited for defining object shapes, class contracts, and extendable structures.
* **Types**: Ideal for more complex type compositions, unions, intersections, and situations requiring flexible type definitions.

### 2. **What is the `keyof` Keyword in TypeScript?**

The `keyof` keyword in TypeScript is a powerful tool that allows you to create a **union type** consisting of all the keys (property names) of an object type. This keyword is particularly helpful when you want to ensure that only valid keys of an object are accessed or manipulated in your code. By doing this, you enforce type safety and avoid errors related to invalid property names.

When you apply `keyof` to an object type, TypeScript generates a new type that is a union of the keys (property names) from the original object type. This union type ensures that only valid property names from the object can be used in your code, providing an extra layer of safety.

For example, suppose you have an object type with several properties. By using `keyof`, TypeScript automatically creates a union type of those properties, so any reference to these properties is guaranteed to be valid. This makes dynamic property access safer and ensures that mistakes such as typos in property names are caught during compilation rather than runtime.

The `keyof` keyword is particularly useful in situations where you need to work with dynamic objects or when defining functions that interact with object properties. It prevents potential runtime errors by restricting the use of invalid or non-existent properties.

Additionally, `keyof` can be used in combination with other TypeScript features, like **mapped types** and **index signatures**, to create even more dynamic and flexible type structures. It’s an important tool for ensuring that your code is predictable and maintainable, especially in larger or more complex codebases.

#### Benefits of Using `keyof`:

* **Prevents invalid property access**: By restricting property access to only valid keys, `keyof` ensures that you're always working with properties that actually exist on the object.
* **Improves type safety**: It helps catch potential bugs at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
* **Enables dynamic property handling**: You can use `keyof` in functions or utilities that need to handle object properties dynamically, knowing that only valid properties can be used.

#### Summary:

The `keyof` keyword in TypeScript is a tool for creating union types of an object's keys. It helps ensure type safety by preventing the use of invalid properties, making your code more predictable and less prone to errors, especially when working with dynamic objects or large data structures.
