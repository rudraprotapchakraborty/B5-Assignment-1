### 1. **Types vs. Interfaces in TypeScript**

Both **interfaces** and **types** in TypeScript are employed to define data type structure, but they differ in aspects as well as usage. The following is a more in-depth explanation of their differences:

#### Major Differences:

* **Declaration Merging:**

* **Interfaces** allow **merging of declarations**, i.e., you may declare the same interface many times, and TypeScript will merge all of them into one. It is extremely convenient when you are forced to extend or override an interface in many places in your code or libraries.
* **Types**, however, do not support declaration merging. You cannot declare a type twice; TypeScript will object. Types are therefore unmovable once declared.

* **Extending:**

* **Interfaces** utilize the `extends` keyword to inherit already defined interfaces or classes. This renders interfaces suitable for defining strongly specified, object-oriented definitions as well as for inheriting already defined interfaces that have already been specified without altering the original.

* **Types** use the `&` (intersection) operator to combine several types into a type. This allows for more complex and expressive type combinations, like combining object types, union types, and so on.

* **Flexibility:**

* **Types** are more general in the context that they can be used to represent a very large range of data structures. Aside from object representation, they can represent primitive types (e.g., `string` or `number`), tuples, unions, intersections, function signatures, etc. This makes types more suitable in scenarios with higher-level compositions of types and more complex relationships.

* **Interfaces** are only to be used for object shape specification or class promises, and are more formal. Interfaces are less flexible than types in the handling of higher-level type unions or non-object structures.

#### When to Use:

* Employ **interfaces** if you need to declare object-oriented, structured types or if you need to extend and combine declarations.

* Use **interfaces** whenever you have fewer alternatives, i.e., whenever you need to describe object shapes, class contracts, or open types.

#### Summary:

* **Interfaces**: Best suited to specify object shapes, class contracts, and inheritable types.

* **Types**: Suitable for more complex type compositions, unions, intersections, and if you want type specification flexibility.

### 2. What is the `keyof` Keyword in TypeScript?

TypeScript's `keyof` keyword is a wonderful feature whereby you can declare a **union type** of all the keys (property names) of an object type. The keyword comes in handy if you wish to ensure proper keys of an object are being utilized or accessed in your code. With this practice, you get type safety and do not incur invalid property name errors.

When you apply `keyof` to an object type, TypeScript provides you a new type that's a union of the property names of the object type you provided. The union type will only permit proper property names of the object in your code, and it's an added level of protection.

For example, if you have an object type with certain properties. TypeScript automatically creates a union type of them using `keyof`, and therefore any use of them will be safe. Dynamic property access is now safe and avoids runtime errors such as property name typos, which are now caught at compile time and not runtime.

The `keyof` keyword comes in handy where you need to deal with dynamic objects or where you are defining functions that get to deal with object properties. It avoids possible runtime errors by limiting the use of non-existent or invalid properties.

Moreover, `keyof` can be combined with other TypeScript types, such as **mapped types** and **index signatures**, to create even more flexible and robust type constructs. It is one of the tools in constructing predictability and code maintainability, particularly in larger or more complicated codebases. #### Benefits of Utilizing `keyof` * **Avoids invalid property access**: By limiting property access to valid keys, `keyof` prevents you from accessing non-existent properties on the object.
* **Enhances type safety**: It eliminates possible bugs at compile time, and that minimizes runtime errors.
* **Enables dynamic property handling**: You can use `keyof` on functions or utilities that must access object properties dynamically, with the assurance that only valid properties are accessed.
#### Summary
The `keyof` keyword in TypeScript is a utility to type-annotate union types of keys of the object. It is type-safe because it prevents you from using non-existent properties, and therefore your code will be more stable and less buggy, particularly when dealing with dynamic objects or large data structures.
